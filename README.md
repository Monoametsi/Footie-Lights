# Footie-Lights
<p> Welcome to Footie-Lights, an application that provides a platform for you to watch football match highlights from a variety of leagues.</p>
<p> The application was created with technologies that included HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB. The application fetches data from a 
third party API called Scorebat, which provides data that consists of football match highlights and other data regarding those matches.</p>
<p>After fetching the data, the application then persists the data to the database. The application then gets the data from the database and displays it
on the browser. </p>
