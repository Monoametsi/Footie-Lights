<h1> Footie-Lights </h1>
<p> Welcome to Footie-Lights, an application that provides a platform for you to watch football match highlights from a variety of leagues.
The application was created with technologies that included HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB.</p>
<p> The application fetches data from a third-party API called Scorebat, which provides data that consists of football match highlights and other data regarding those matches.
After fetching the data, the application then persists the data to the database. The application then gets the data from the database and displays it
on the browser. </p>
